      <h2>
        <p>A quote from the sourced link below</p>
        <p>“'The perception of red has evolved in such important events and experiences,' says Elliot. 'Red is the colour of ripe fruit, the angry face across from you, the person showing sexual arousal.' In this way, it will always be associated with survival, with connotations and influences that run as deep as the blood in our veins. Perhaps we are only confirming what our ancestors realised when they first started painting their bodies: there is no other colour like it."</p>
