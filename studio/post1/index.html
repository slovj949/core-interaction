      <h1>Post 1—Study Shows Red Plates Make You Eat Less</h1>
      <p>In a study, published by the journal <i>Appetite</i>, researches gave 240 participants popcorn and chocolate served on either red, white, or blue plates. Those who ate off of red plates ate less overall than those who ate off of the white or blue plates.</p>
      <p>Although plate science is still in its infancy, scientists believe that the lack of eating is due to the color red, as it is associated with prohibition and danger.</p>
