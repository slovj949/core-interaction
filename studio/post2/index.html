      <h1>Post 2—Red Part 1</h1>
      <p>One thing I never knew about the color red is that it actually enhances metabolism and it raises blood pressure. It makes sense that it would do those things based on the other things red means psychologically. </p>
      <p>While researching I also learned that red is associated with anger and aggression and dominance. It’s even been found that athletes wearing a red jersey are more likely to win. I don’t particularly care about sports but I found that interesting.</p>
      <p>Red is also associated with passion. A study showed that people wearing red are consistently rated more attractive than people wearing any other color.</p>
      <p>Danger is also always associated with red, and if someone is surrounded by too much red the person may become stressed out very easily. </p>
